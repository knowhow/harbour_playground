	wxHarbour - [x]Harbour bindings for wxWidgets a portable GUI
	
Last Revised: 12 aug 2007

Requeriments:

Windows[95][2000][XP]:
  MinGW: is recommended to install the package with the "Automated MinGW
    Installer" (MinGW-5.1.3-exe) , select the full option.
  MSYS: This provides a convenient shell and tools needed for compilation.
	MinGW & MSYS packages can be obtained from:
        http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=2435
  wxWidgets: This package can be obtained from:
	http://www.wxwidgets.org/downloads/
	Last stable version (currently 2.8.4) is ok.
  Harbour: this package can be obtained from:
	http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=681

Linux:
  wxWidgets: Depends of the distro used you can install from the package manager
    (yum, yast, apt-get, synaptics).
  Harbour: Depens of the distro used you have builded packages availables from
    the web.    

MAC:
  - Need one to make tests :) , but theoretically wxHarbour can be builded here


1. First at all, you must have Harbour installed and working ok.
2. The same as above with wxWidgets.
    You can check this by running the following command in a shell:
    $ wx-config --version
    this must return the wxWidgets version used (2.6.3 , 2.4.8).
2. Unpack the wxharbour package file to a directory
3. run "make all" on the wxharbour/samples dir
4. If all the above is correct you now have the binary samples builded.
